# LU Factorization Algorithm
- The function named luFactor is an algorithm that determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix. For this, it uses partial pivoting.

### Inputs:
- A: coefficient matrix

### Outputs:
- A: coefficient matrix (optional)
- L: lower triangular matrix
- U: upper triangular matrix
- P: the pivot matrix

#### Limitations:
- Must only have one input
- The matrix entered must be a square
